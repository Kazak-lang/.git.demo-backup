Legends never die
When the world is callin' you
Can you hear them screaming out your name
Legends never die

They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Relentles,you survive

They never lose hope
when everything's cold and the fighting's near
it's deep in their bones, they'll ride

for tag only
